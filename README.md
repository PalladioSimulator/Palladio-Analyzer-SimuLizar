# Palladio-Analyzer-SimuLizar
SimuLizar is a Palladio plug-in for analyzing self-adaptive systems, such as cloud computing systems, at design-time. With SimuLizar, we want to provide modeling support for self-adaptation rules as well as new analysis for scalability, elasticity, and efficiency.

A documentation of the contained testing framework for SimuLizar-based simulations can be found [here](bundles/org.palladiosimulator.simulizar.test.commons/README.md)
